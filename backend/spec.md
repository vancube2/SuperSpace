# Twitter Space Clone Project Specification

## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to create a clone of Twitter Spaces, a live audio conversation feature, with additional video capabilities. The backend will be built using Rust, providing a robust and performant foundation for real-time communication.

## 2. Key Features

- Space Creation: Users can create a space and generate an invite link.
- User Joining: Users can join spaces using invite links.
- Audio Communication: Users can communicate via audio within a space.
- Video Communication: Users can enable video communication within a space.
- Chat Functionality: Users can send public messages to everyone in the space or private messages to specific users.
- Screen Sharing: Users can share their screens with others in the space.
- Admin Privileges: Space owners have additional control over the space.

## 3. Admin Controls

- Lock Space: Ability to require approval for new listeners joining the space.
- Permission Settings: Control user abilities for:
  - Video usage
  - Microphone usage
  - Chat participation
  - Screen sharing

## 4. Technical Stack

### Backend
- Language: Rust
- Web Framework: Actix-web
- Database: PostgreSQL with Diesel ORM
- WebSocket: tokio-tungstenite for real-time communication
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

### Frontend (not specified, but suggested)
- Framework: React or Vue.js
- WebRTC: for peer-to-peer audio/video communication

## 5. Architecture

- Microservices Architecture:
  1. User Service: Handles user authentication and management.
  2. Space Service: Manages space creation, joining, and settings.
  3. Communication Service: Handles real-time audio, video, and chat functionality.
  4. Admin Service: Manages admin controls and permissions.

- Message Queue: RabbitMQ for inter-service communication.
- API Gateway: To route requests to appropriate microservices.

## 6. Database Schema (High-level)

- Users: id, username, email, password_hash, created_at
- Spaces: id, name, owner_id, is_locked, created_at
- SpaceMembers: id, space_id, user_id, role, joined_at
- Messages: id, space_id, sender_id, receiver_id (null for public), content, sent_at
- Permissions: id, space_id, user_id, can_video, can_audio, can_chat, can_share_screen

## 7. API Endpoints (Core)

- POST /api/users/register
- POST /api/users/login
- POST /api/spaces/create
- POST /api/spaces/{id}/join
- GET /api/spaces/{id}/info
- POST /api/spaces/{id}/message
- PUT /api/spaces/{id}/settings

## 8. WebSocket Events

- user_joined
- user_left
- audio_started
- audio_stopped
- video_started
- video_stopped
- message_sent
- screen_share_started
- screen_share_stopped

## 9. Security Considerations

- Implement proper authentication and authorization.
- Use HTTPS for all communications.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Implement end-to-end encryption for private messages.

## 10. Scalability Considerations

- Use horizontal scaling for microservices.
- Implement caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.
- Use a CDN for static assets.
- Consider using WebRTC's peer-to-peer model to reduce server load for audio/video.

## 11. Testing Strategy

- Unit Tests: For individual components and functions.
- Integration Tests: For API endpoints and service interactions.
- Load Tests: To ensure the system can handle multiple concurrent users.
- Security Tests: Including penetration testing and vulnerability scans.

## 12. Deployment

- Containerize the application using Docker.
- Use Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling.
- Implement CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI or GitHub Actions.

## 13. Monitoring and Logging

- Implement logging using the `log` crate in Rust.
- Use Prometheus for metrics collection.
- Set up Grafana for visualization of metrics and logs.

## 14. Future Considerations

- Implement user profiles and friend lists.
- Add recording functionality for spaces.
- Develop mobile applications for iOS and Android.
- Integrate with popular streaming platforms.

This specification provides a solid foundation for building a Twitter Space clone with a Rust backend. As development progresses, more detailed technical decisions will need to be made, and this document should be updated accordingly.
